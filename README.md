Hello! This is my first individual game development in c++. In this game I had used SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). 
TO run this game in your pc you have to install sfml library from the sfml official website. The second this you have to install
that is Visual Stodio Community editon. Set up the sfml graphic library, audio library just see the youtube tutorial that how to set up sfml in the vsual stodio. Enjoy the game.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
